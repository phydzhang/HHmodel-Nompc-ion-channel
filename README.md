# HHmodel-Nompc-ion-channel

This program is my rotation project in Peking university at the beginning of my phD.
Using H-H model and other method like gating-spring model to simulate the Nompc ion channel.
Nompc ion channel is a mechanoseneory ion channel in Drosophila.

Maybe the model of Nompc is wrong. After all it is a proposal.
Because the molecular mechanism of Nompc inactivation is unknown now.
